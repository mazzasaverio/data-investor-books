## Binary search

Search algorithms can be classified in various ways.

- One way is based on whether the underlying collection is **static** or **dynamic**, meaning that inserts and deletes are interleaved with searching.
- Another factor to consider is whether it is worth the computational cost to preprocess the data in order to speed up subsequent queries. Additionally, we can explore if there are any statistical properties of the data that can be leveraged.
- Lastly, we need to decide whether to operate directly on the data or transform it.

When given an arbitrary collection of n keys, the only way to determine if a search key is present is by examining each element, resulting in O(n) time complexity.

**Binary search, on the other hand, is a natural elimination-based strategy for searching a sorted array. The idea is to eliminate half of the keys from consideration by keeping the keys in sorted order.**

If the search key is not equal to the middle element of the array, one of the two sets of keys to the left and right of the middle element can be eliminated from further consideration.

Binary search can be written in various ways, such as recursive, iterative, and using different idioms for conditionals. Here is an iterative implementation:

```python
def bsearch(t, A):
    L, U = 0, len(A) - 1
    while L <= U:
        M = L + (U - L) / 2
        if A[M] < t:
            L = M + 1
        elif A[M] == t:
            return M
        else:
            U = M - 1
    return -1
```

In the given Python code, the function `bsearch(t, A)` takes two arguments:

- `t`: the target value you are searching for
- `A`: the sorted array in which to search for the target

Note: we could also write M = (L + U)/2 but this would lead to generating an overflow.

### Time Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of binary search is *T(*n*)=*T*(*n*/2)+c*, where *c* is a constant time for the comparison operation. This simplifies to *O*(log*n*), which is significantly better than the O(n) time required for linear search on unsorted arrays.

One downside is that binary search requires the array to be sorted, which takes *O*(_n_ log n) time. However, if you’re performing multiple searches, the initial sorting time becomes less significant.

Additionally, binary search has several variants that handle different edge cases, like finding the first or last occurrence of a number, which require careful consideration to implement correctly.

### Tips

1. **Effective search tool:** This method is not only applicable to sorted arrays but can also be used to search within any interval of real numbers or integers.
2. **Avoid Complete Sorting When Not Necessary**: If you're working on a problem where you sort an array and then perform some operations that are faster than the sorting process (for example, operations that are linear O(n) or logarithmic O(log n)), it might be more efficient to look for a solution that doesn't involve completely sorting the array. There might be more efficient ways to obtain the needed result without the overhead of a sort.
3. **Time/Space Trade-offs**: This refers to the balance between the computer memory used (space complexity) and the time it takes to run an algorithm (time complexity). For example, you might make multiple passes through a dataset (which takes more time) to use less memory, or you might store more data in memory (using more space) to reduce the number of passes and, therefore, the time the algorithm takes.
